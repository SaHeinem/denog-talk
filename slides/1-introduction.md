# Background of security.txt (RFC 9116)

## Origin and early development

- security.txt began in September 2017 as an Internet Draft proposed by Edwin Foudil.
- The original version included four main guidelines.
  1. Contact to be reachable
  2. Encryption to ensure authenticity
  3. Expiration to indicate data is not stale
  4. Policy outlines the procedures and expectations
- The goal was to help researchers contact website operators about security vulnerabilities.
- Although the idea received positive feedback from the security community, initial adoption by leading websites was low.

# Key milestones and standardization

- 2019: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommended that federal agencies implement security.txt. This underscored the growing importance of the standard.
- December 2019: The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) conducted a “last call” for the draft specification.
- April 2022: The standard was formally published as RFC 9116 after being accepted by the IETF.
- As of April 2024 the German Federal Agency for Information Security (BSI) recommends the adoption of security.txt
