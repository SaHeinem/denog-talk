# Sascha

I am Sascha, co-founder of EdgeOps.

In addition to providing support in the operation of data centers and networked systems, I deal with topics related to data protection, information security as well as audits - and help companies to make their operational and security processes not only compliant, but also viable in practice.

In my work, technical depth meets realism: I advise companies on how they can integrate security and data protection not as a chore, but as part of their daily practice - without losing the fun in technology.

# Talk: Security.txt across the industry

This talk explores the adoption of `security.txt`, as defined in [RFC 9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116), that enables websites to publish security contact information in a consistent and accessible way. We begin with a brief introduction to the RFC and the motivation behind standardized vulnerability disclosure.
But is this even important to the network industry? To find out, we conclude with a focused analysis of security.txt adoption among organizations represented by this conferenceâ€™s attendees, highlighting real-world trends, blind spots, and where we go from here.
